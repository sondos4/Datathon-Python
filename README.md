# Datathon

### Project Description
As part of our Final project (Datathon), we completed the data analysis in Python and created new variables in order to perform an RFM analysis. (RFM.ipnyb)
We then needed to add those newly created variables to our master table (Merging RFM to master.ipynb)

### RFM Analysis
### R: Recency
We add a Recency variable to identify what was the most recent purchase made by a customer. 

### F: Frequency
We added a Frequency variable to identify how frequent the customer purchases are. (count of transactions) 

### M: Monetary value: 
We added a Monetary variable to measure the amount spent by each customer.
